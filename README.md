This is a simple DC brushed motor controller with encoder feedback, step-direction interface, and optical home switch. It was originally built for a modular robotics application using low-power DC motors and very coarse (low resolution) encoders. This circuit may find application in CNC and 3D printing applications, but it is likely that certain modifications will need to be made (in software for example) to make use of higher resolution encoders.
